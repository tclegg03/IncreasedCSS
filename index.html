    <p class="aboutme"> Hello! If you are reading this, then you probably want to know a little bit more about me. I graduated with a bachelors of science in biology from Illinois State Univeristy. For the past 10 years I have worked various jobs in the medical field including being a nurses assistant, a sterile technician, and a histology technician.</p> 
    <p class="aboutme"> Recently I began working towards switching careers. After examining my options I found that web design and computer programming was the correct field for me. Currently I am bettering myself with key programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </p>
    <p class="aboutme"> When not studying new coding language or assisting doctors at the local hospital I enjoy spending time outdoors. You can usually find me taking trips to visit national parks with my dog for quality camping, hiking, and fishing. If it is too cold out to camp comfortably then I can be found on the mountain side snowboarding and drinking hot chocolate. </p>
